      <h2>Summary of Life and Career</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1941</strong> - Born in Broxville, New York to Bell Labs scientist Alistair E Ritchie. Later moved
          to Summit New York. Later graduated from Harvard University with degrees in Physics and Applied Mathematics.</li>
        <li><strong>1967</strong> - began working at Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center.</li>
        <li><strong>1968</strong> - Defended PhD thesis on Program Structure and Computational Complexity at Harvard
          University.</li>
        <li><strong>Late 1960s</strong> - Worked on Multics operating system with Ken Thompson.</li>
        <li><strong>1969</strong> - Began working building a new operating system from scratch with Ken Thompson and
          others. In 1970, Brian Kernigan suggested the name "Unix".</li>
        <li><strong>1972</strong> - Created the C programming language, which later replaced B (which was created by
          Ken Thompson) to supplement system level development of Unix.</li>
        <li><strong>mid to late 1970s</strong> - Collaborated with Robert Morris on developing a ciphertext-only attack
          on the M-209 US cipher machine.</li>
        <li><strong>1978</strong> - Publish the first version of The C Programming Language with Brian Kernigan.</li>
        <li><strong>1983</strong> - Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson recieve the Turing Award for the development of
          generic operating systems and the development of Unix.</li>
        <li><strong>1990</strong> - Both Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Award by the
          Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers for the development of Unix and the C programming language.</li>
        <li><strong>mid-1990s</strong> - As part of a restructuring of AT&T, Ritchie was transferred to Lucent
          Technologies.</li>
        <li><strong>1997</strong> - Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson were made Fellows of the Computer History Museum
          for the creation of Unix and the development of the C programming language.</li>
        <li><strong>1999</strong> - Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson recieve the National Medal of Technology for
          inventing Unix and the C programming language.</li>
        <li><strong>2005</strong> - Dennis Ritchie recieved the Achiwvement Award from the Industrial Institute for his
          contributions to science and technology and his development of the Unix operating system.</li>
        <li><strong>2007</strong> - Retired as Head of Software System Research at Lucent Technologies.</li>
        <li><strong>2011</strong> - Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the Japan Prize for Information Technology for
          their work in the development of Unix.</li>
        <li><strong>2011</strong> - On October 12, Dennis Ritchie was found found dead in his home in Berkeley Heights,
          New Jersey. News of his death was over shadows by the dead of Steve Jobs which occurred the week before.</li>
